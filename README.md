# duplicate-annihilator
Built with Python, this exe file detects and deletes any duplicate in it's root folder

**How it works?**
The version v1.0 only supports xls and xlsx files. If two files are present with the same name in a folder, one with .xls extension, other with .xlsx extension, just run the exe file and it will delete the file(s) with .xls extension. So after the process is done, you'll be left with only the .xlsx format files
